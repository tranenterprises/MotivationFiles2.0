# Product Requirements Document: Daily Motivation Voice App

## Introduction/Overview

The Daily Motivation Voice App is a React/Next.js web application that provides users with daily motivational content delivered through AI-generated voice-overs in the style of David Goggins. The app addresses the need for consistent, high-quality motivational content to help users build and maintain a daily habit of consuming inspirational material. Each day, users will receive a new punchy quote with professional voice-over, covering various themes including motivation, wisdom, grindset mentality, reflection, and discipline.

## Goals

1. **Deliver daily motivation**: Provide fresh motivational content every single day (365 quotes per year)
2. **Build consistent habits**: Help users establish a daily routine of consuming motivational content
3. **Provide variety**: Ensure equal distribution across motivation themes (raw motivation, wisdom, grindset, self-reflection, discipline)
4. **Create engaging experience**: Use high-quality AI voice-overs in David Goggins style to maximize impact
5. **Enable content discovery**: Allow users to browse and revisit previous motivational content through a chronological repository

## User Stories

1. **As a user seeking daily motivation**, I want to visit the app each morning and immediately see today's quote with a play button, so that I can quickly get my daily dose of inspiration.

2. **As a user building consistency**, I want to access the app daily and know there will always be fresh content, so that I can maintain my motivational routine without monotony.

3. **As a user who missed previous days**, I want to browse through a chronological list of all previous quotes, so that I can catch up on content or revisit favorites.

4. **As a user who values variety**, I want the app to provide different types of motivational content (wisdom, grindset, reflection, etc.), so that I receive well-rounded inspiration.

5. **As a user on-the-go**, I want the voice-over to sound natural and engaging like David Goggins, so that the content feels authentic and impactful.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Daily Content Generation**: The system must generate one new motivational quote with voice-over daily at a scheduled time (e.g., 5:00 AM).

2. **Content Categorization**: The system must equally distribute quotes across five categories: raw motivation, wisdom/life lessons, grindset/hustle mentality, self-reflection/introspection, and discipline/habit-building.

3. **Voice-Over Integration**: The system must integrate with ElevenLabs API to generate David Goggins-style voice-overs for each quote.

4. **Today's Content Display**: The homepage must prominently display today's quote with a clearly visible play button for the audio.

5. **Audio Playback**: The system must provide audio controls (play/pause) and display audio duration/progress.

6. **Content Repository**: The system must maintain a chronological archive of all previous quotes accessible via a dedicated page.

7. **Repository Navigation**: The archive page must list quotes in reverse chronological order (newest first) with dates and play buttons.

8. **Responsive Design**: The application must work seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

9. **Content Persistence**: The system must store all generated quotes and audio files for permanent access.

10. **LLM Integration**: The system must connect to an AI service (OpenAI GPT, Claude, etc.) to generate original motivational quotes in various styles.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **User Authentication**: No user accounts, login systems, or personalization features
2. **Social Features**: No sharing, commenting, or community features  
3. **Push Notifications**: No mobile notifications or email alerts
4. **Search Functionality**: No search or filtering within the repository
5. **Favorites/Bookmarking**: No ability to save or bookmark specific quotes
6. **Multiple Voice Options**: Only David Goggins-style voice, no other voice variations
7. **Custom Content**: Users cannot submit their own quotes or request specific content
8. **Analytics/Tracking**: No user behavior tracking or analytics dashboard

## Design Considerations

1. **Clean, Minimal Interface**: Focus user attention on the daily quote with minimal distractions
2. **Bold Typography**: Use strong, impactful fonts that match the motivational theme
3. **Dark Theme Aesthetic**: Consider a dark, powerful color scheme that aligns with the David Goggins brand
4. **Mobile-First Design**: Ensure excellent mobile experience since users may access during workouts or commutes
5. **Audio-First Experience**: Make the play button prominent and audio controls intuitive
6. **Fast Loading**: Optimize for quick load times, especially for daily visitors

## Technical Considerations

1. **Next.js Framework**: Use Next.js for server-side rendering and API routes
2. **Daily Cron Jobs**: Implement scheduled content generation using Vercel Cron Jobs or similar
3. **External APIs**:
   - ElevenLabs API for voice synthesis
   - OpenAI API (or similar) for quote generation
4. **File Storage**: Use cloud storage (AWS S3, Vercel Blob) for audio files
5. **Database**: Simple database (SQLite, PostgreSQL) to store quotes, dates, and metadata
6. **Audio Format**: Use web-compatible audio formats (MP3, OGG) for broad browser support
7. **Error Handling**: Robust fallbacks if voice generation or LLM services are unavailable
8. **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper rate limiting for external API calls

## Success Metrics

1. **Daily Active Users**: Track unique visitors per day to measure habit formation
2. **Audio Engagement**: Measure percentage of users who play the daily audio
3. **Return Visitors**: Monitor percentage of users who return multiple days per week
4. **Repository Usage**: Track how often users browse previous content
5. **Technical Reliability**: Maintain 99%+ uptime for daily content availability
6. **Audio Quality**: Ensure voice synthesis completion rate above 95%

## Open Questions

1. **Content Moderation**: How will we ensure generated quotes maintain appropriate quality and tone?
2. **Voice Consistency**: How can we maintain consistent David Goggins-style voice across different quote lengths and themes?
3. **Backup Content**: What fallback mechanism should we have if LLM or voice generation fails on a given day?

5. **Content Approval**: Should there be a manual review process before publishing daily content?
6. **Timezone Handling**: What timezone should determine "daily" content release?
7. **Performance Optimization**: How will we handle audio file sizes and loading times as the repository grows?
